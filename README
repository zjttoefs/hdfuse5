What is hdfuse5?
================

hdfuse5 is a filesystem in userspace (FUSE https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse or
MacFUSE https://osxfuse.github.io/) to explore data stored in
hierarchical hdf5 files (see https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/).

All files in the directory given as the hdfuse5 root are mirrored into the
mountpoint with all hdf5 files being presented as a directories. HDF5 Groups
within the files are mapped into further directories, data arrays are files,
and attributes are shown as extended filesystem attributes. Non-hdf5 files
and directories are just mirrored unchanged.

The main purpose is to enable a quick access to the contents of hdf5 files
with normal system tools (grep, find, cat, file browser, etc.).

What do I need to run hdfuse5?
==============================

 * python (https://www.python.org/)
 * h5py (https://www.h5py.org/)
 * fusepy (see below)
 * FUSE or MacFUSE support in you operating system and the required
   permissions to use it. That rules out any Windows variants.

This software uses fusepy available from https://github.com/fusepy/fusepy
It provides a simple python interface to FUSE and MacFUSE in a single file.
fusepy is under the BSD License so it could be included here for convenience.
There have been a few updates to it since, that are not incorporated.

Most distributions have a 'fuse' user group you need to be a member of in
order to be allowed to use fuse (and therefore hdfuse5).

What do I need to do?
=====================

Provided the above requirements are met you can do this from within the
source directory:


        $ ls
        exampleroot  fuse.py  fuse.pyc  hdfuse5.py  LICENSE  README
        $ ls -l exampleroot # contains an hdf5 file

        $ mkdir mnt # create mountpoint
        $ python hdfuse5.py exampleroot mnt # mount
        $ # what's in the mountpoint now? a directory for the file!
        $ ls -l mnt

Random other questions
======================

What kind of performance can I expect?
--------------------------------------

None. hdfuse5 was coded as a proof of principle. It holds no state, there
is no caching, no optimisations whatsoever. This left the code quite simple
and concise but still proved to be good enough for the main application:
quick inspection of the file structure of a limited number of files.
Future versions may see some optimisations if a strong enough case is made.
Feel free to express any ideas you have.


Why do I have to mount a directory? Why can't I mount a single file?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no reason why that could not be supported. Would be quite simple
really. But it is not deemed as useful. The main motivation was to explore
multiple files easily.


Can I have write support?
-------------------------

That's unlikely to ever be added. Setting up the data storage in hdf5 properly
requires some knowledge or assumptions about your data. As a generic tool
hdfuse5 cannot make any reasonable assumptions. To convey any knowledge
about the data a client program would need be adapted specifically to
writing data through hdfuse5, and hdfuse5 would need to expose a special
interface. In that case it would be better to use a proper hdf5 API in the
first place.


Any drawbacks?
--------------

hdf5 files cannot be opened "normally" by HDF5 aware tools in the tree
mounted via hdfuse5, because to the operating system they look like directories.


Any future plans?
-----------------

Links in hdf5 could be presented as symbolic link in the mounted directory.

Another idea would get to present data that could be interpreted as image
data in the hdf5 in a format that could be read by standard image file
readers, e.g. tiff. This might be better done in a field specific adaption
though.
